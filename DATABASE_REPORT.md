## Data Quality Checks ✅

### Critical Fields - NO NULLS:
- linearid: 0 nulls
- county_fips: 0 nulls  
- state_code: 0 nulls
- mtfcc: 0 nulls

### Geometry Data:
- **5,203,313 roads have real geometry (100%)** ✅

- ✅ Calculations use `/1000.0` for meters to kilometers

## Ready for Production
- **Geometry**: ✅ 100% imported - all roads have accurate lengths
- **Business Data**: Ready to start crawling with Google Maps API
- **Name Mapping**: Road name mapping table created for TIGER → Google conversion

## Excluded by Request
- Delaware (DE) - Not in database
- Vermont (VT) - Not in database

## Database Size
- Total: ~2.7 GB
- Roads table: 1.55 GB
