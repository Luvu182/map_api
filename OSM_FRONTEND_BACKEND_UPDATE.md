# OSM Frontend and Backend Update Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the Google Maps crawler application to use OpenStreetMap (OSM) data instead of TIGER data, as requested.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Updates

1. **CrawlControl.js**
   - Changed `linearid` to `osm_id` throughout the component
   - Changed `fullname` to `name` for road names
   - Changed `mtfcc` to `highway` for road type display
   - Updated crawl status tracking to use `osm_id` instead of `linearid`

2. **crawler.js (API)**
   - Updated mock data to use `osm_id` and `name` fields

3. **MapView.js**
   - Changed `selectedRoad.fullname` to `selectedRoad.name`

### Backend Updates

1. **main.py**
   - Updated all references from `linearid` to `osm_id`
   - Changed `fullname` to `name` throughout
   - Updated database queries to use `osm_roads_main` table
   - Fixed the `crawl_road_with_keyword` function to work with OSM data

2. **postgres_client.py**
   - Updated `get_unique_road_names` to query OSM data with proper field mappings
   - Changed road categorization to use OSM highway types
   - Updated `update_crawl_status` to accept `road_osm_id` instead of `road_linearid`
   - Fixed `save_business` method to use correct field names

3. **models.py**
   - Already using OSM-compatible fields (no changes needed)

4. **enhanced_search.py**
   - Completely rewrote to work with OSM data
   - Changed from `road_linearid` to `road_osm_id`
   - Updated queries to use `osm_roads_main` table
   - Added support for OSM `ref` field (e.g., I-5, US-101)

5. **google_maps.py**
   - Updated `parse_business` method to accept `road_osm_id` instead of `road_linearid`

### Database Schema Updates

1. **schemas.sql**
   - Updated businesses table to use `road_osm_id` (BIGINT) instead of `road_linearid`
   - Updated crawl_jobs table similarly
   - Rewrote views and functions to work with OSM data

2. **schemas_crawl_status.sql**
   - Changed `road_linearid` to `road_osm_id` (BIGINT)
   - Updated indexes accordingly

## Key Mappings

### TIGER → OSM Field Mappings
- `linearid` → `osm_id` (BIGINT)
- `fullname` → `name`
- `mtfcc` → `highway` (OSM road classification)
- `roads` table → `osm_roads_main` table

### OSM Road Categories
The system now uses OSM highway classifications:
- **Highway**: motorway, trunk
- **Major Road**: primary, secondary, tertiary
- **Residential**: residential
- **Service Road**: service
- **Other**: all other types

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Migration**
   - Drop and recreate the `crawl_status` table with new schema
   - Drop and recreate the `businesses` and `crawl_jobs` tables
   - Recreate views and functions

2. **Frontend Testing**
   - Verify road display shows OSM names correctly
   - Test crawl functionality with OSM road IDs
   - Ensure filtering by road type works with new categories

3. **Backend Testing**
   - Test road search endpoints return OSM data
   - Verify crawl status tracking works with OSM IDs
   - Test business saving with OSM road associations

## Notes

- The system now fully uses OSM data with no TIGER dependencies
- All road references use `osm_id` as the primary identifier
- Road names come from the OSM `name` field
- Road types use OSM `highway` classification
