# OSM Import Final Status Report
*Last Updated: December 7, 2024*

## Overview
Successfully migrated from TIGER/Line data to OpenStreetMap (OSM) data for US road network.

## Import Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Import Summary
- **All 49 states imported successfully** (including DC)
- **27,157,444** total road segments in database
- **7,150,485** segments with names (26.3%)
- **2,768,406** unique roads (grouped by name + county)
- **323 counties** covered (all counties with cities >100k population)

### State Import Details
Top states by road segments:
1. California: 3,810,619 segments (29 counties)
2. Texas: 2,473,734 segments (28 counties)
3. Florida: 2,154,996 segments (22 counties)
4. New York: 1,182,375 segments (14 counties)
5. Illinois: 1,124,034 segments (8 counties)

**Note**: MN, NH, NC were initially reported as failed but are actually imported:
- Minnesota: 455,340 segments (6 counties)
- North Carolina: 775,669 segments (10 counties)
- New Hampshire: 127,000 segments (2 counties)

## Database Structure

### Main Table: `osm_roads_main`
```sql
- osm_id: BIGINT (Primary key from OSM)
- name: TEXT (Road name)
- highway: VARCHAR(100) (OSM road type)
- ref: VARCHAR(150) (Road reference like I-5, US-101)
- state_code: VARCHAR(2)
- county_fips: VARCHAR(10)
- geometry: GEOMETRY(LINESTRING, 4326)
- tags: JSONB (Additional OSM tags)
- lanes: INTEGER
- maxspeed: VARCHAR(100)
- surface: VARCHAR(200)
- oneway: VARCHAR(50)
```

### Key Statistics
- Average segments per unique road: 2.6
- Roads with names: 26.3% of all segments
- Unique searchable roads: 2.77 million

## Import Scripts

### Active Scripts
1. **`import_all_osm_direct.py`** - Main import script (used for all states)
2. **`reimport_minnesota_only.py`** - Backup script for single state import

## Frontend/Backend Updates

### Dashboard Updates
- ✅ Shows total segments: 27.16M
- ✅ Shows unique roads with names: 2.77M (not 7.15M segments)
- ✅ Correct state road counts displayed
- ✅ All states shown as imported

### API Updates
- `/stats` endpoint now returns unique road count
- Road queries group by name + county
- No more counting individual segments as roads

## Performance

### Query Optimization
```sql
-- Count unique roads efficiently
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(name, '|', county_fips)) 
FROM osm_roads_main 
WHERE name IS NOT NULL;
```

### Indexes
- Spatial index on geometry
- B-tree on (state_code, county_fips)
- B-tree on name

## Data Quality

### Coverage Analysis
- 100% of target counties have road data
- 26.3% of road segments have names
- Major highways (motorway/trunk): ~1% of roads
- Residential roads: ~60% of roads
- Service/other roads: ~39% of roads

## Next Steps

1. **No more imports needed** - All states complete
2. **Start crawling** - 2.77M unique roads ready for Google Maps search
3. **Monitor performance** - With 27M segments, queries need optimization

## Technical Notes

### Why segments vs unique roads?
- OSM splits long roads into segments at intersections
- Same road name appears multiple times in different segments
- Frontend should show unique roads (2.77M) not segments (7.15M)
- Average road has 2.6 segments
